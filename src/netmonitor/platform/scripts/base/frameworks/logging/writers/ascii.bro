##! Interface for the ASCII log writer.  Redefinable options are available
##! to tweak the output format of ASCII logs.
##!
##! The ASCII writer supports currently one writer-specific filter option via
##! ``config``: setting ``tsv`` to the string ``T`` turns the output into
##! "tab-separated-value" mode where only a single header row with the column
##! names is printed out as meta information, with no "# fields" prepended; no
##! other meta data gets included in that mode.
##!
##! Example filter using this::
##!
##!    local my_filter: Log::Filter = [$name = "my-filter", $writer = Log::WRITER_ASCII, $config = table(["tsv"] = "T")];
##!
