	          process ID which allows the server to map a specific state change
			  to a URL. A client can support Bulk if:
			   - it can be started with multiple instances of which each instance 
			     visits a URL
			   - it can be started in its own process for each URL
			   - it can be started in a way that allows one to derive its processID
			   - processID of each URL needs to be set on the URL object
	   dac -  here the urls are visited in bulk and if a unauthorized state change is
	          detected, a divide-and-conquer algorithm is applied to find the specific
			  malicious URL (note that since URLs are visited multiple times, there is
			  a danger of loosing malicious URLs due to IP tracking functionality. A 
			  caching mechanism needs to be applied). A client can support DAC if:
			   - it can be started with multiple instances of which each instance 
			     visits a URL
	   seq -  here the urls are visited one after another. This is the slowest method, but 
	          doesnt require special capabilities by the plugin.
