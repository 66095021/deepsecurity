/*
	Class: ProcessManager
	
	Manages the process on the system. It provides a central place where objects can
	request the process paths of a process id. It is mainly used by the monitors so
	that they can accuratly retrieve the process path. When a process event occurs this
	the ProcessManager is informed and the path names of the created process are added
	to a map. When a object requests the process name it looks the id up in the map, if
	it is not found it will perform a GetImageFullPath() which is cached and if requested
	later will be returned. If it succeeds the cached path is returned. Testing has shown
	that GetImageFullPath is never called this is because the process monitor successfully
	receives a process event before the process actually does anything on the system.

	This is a singleton so only one object is available

	WARNIING/TODO Not threadsafe
