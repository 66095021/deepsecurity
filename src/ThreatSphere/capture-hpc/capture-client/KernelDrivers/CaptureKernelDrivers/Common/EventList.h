/// SharedEventList
/// An event list that is a contigious block of memory that is shared between 
/// userspace and kernel space.
/// 
/// Events and Data are stored in a buffer that is managed by a BitMap. The
/// EventList, Events, and Data are entirely stored in the shared buffer,
/// this means that pointers such as the list of events or data are stored
/// as offsets rather than pointers with the base address being the EventList 
/// itself. This allows the EventList to be shared between userspace and 
/// kernelspace.
///
/// Please note that the synchronisation is not yet complete. And there also
/// maybe a security risk using this technique.
