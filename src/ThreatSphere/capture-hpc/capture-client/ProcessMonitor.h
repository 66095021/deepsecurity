	Class: ProcessMonitor

	Manages the CaptureProcessMonitor kernel driver. It waits for a kernel event to
	be singalled which tells it that a process event has occured. This is retrieved
	from kernel space and parsed into a process event which is passed onto the
	<ProcessManager> and then checked for exclusion and passed onto all objects which
	are attached to the onProcessEvent slot

	Implements: <IRunnable>, <VisitorListener>, <Monitor>
